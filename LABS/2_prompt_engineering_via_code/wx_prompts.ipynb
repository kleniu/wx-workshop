    "NEW YORK, Sept. 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- To help close the global artificial intelligence (AI) skills gap, today IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced a commitment to train two million learners in AI by the end of 2026, with a focus on underrepresented communities. To achieve this goal at a global scale, IBM is expanding AI education collaborations with universities globally, collaborating with partners to deliver AI training to adult learners, and launching new generative AI coursework through IBM SkillsBuild. This will expand upon IBM's existing programs and career-building platforms to offer enhanced access to AI education and in-demand technical roles.  \n",
    "According to a recent global study conducted by IBM Institute of Business Value, surveyed executives estimate that implementing AI and automation will require 40% of their workforce to reskill over the next three years, mostly those in entry-level positions. This further reinforces that generative AI is creating a demand for new roles and skills.\n",
    "\"AI skills will be essential to tomorrow's workforce,\" said Justina Nixon-Saintil, IBM Vice President & Chief Impact Officer. \"That's why we are investing in AI training, with a commitment to reach two million learners in three years, and expanding IBM SkillsBuild to collaborate with universities and nonprofits on new generative AI education for learners all over the world.\"\n",
