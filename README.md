# IBM watsonx technical enablement 

Welcome to the technical workshops on the basics of prompt engineering using the watsonx.ai module.
During the lab, you will learn how to interact with watsonx.ai module's Large Language Models (LLM), their capabilities, and how to properly communicate with them. Additionally, this workshop will allow you to familiarize yourself with the structure of the watsonx.ai, which is part of the watsonx platform - an IBM tool that enables work with generative artificial intelligence and classical AI.
